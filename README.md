## Description
This is a project curated to be the backend of a social network API that utilizes MongoDB. It allows for the CRUD of Users, Thoughts and reactions to thoughts. It also allows for users to add and delete their friends if they desire to. 

## Usage
To assure your mongoDB server is running remember to run "mongod" for windows users on their terminal before running "npm start" in the VS terminal. As for any HTTP requests I used Insomnia and found it worked well. If you run into an error that states you are repeating keys that are supposed to be unique assure you delete any table that it is writing to before running the application. 

## Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository and anything I think would be amazing I am more than glad to merge and give credit where credit's due. 

## Installation
Download the project via ZIP on the github link below. Make sure you have MongoDB downloaded at the least and Compass if you want total control over your database but it is not required. Once downloaded just npm I to install dependencies and you are ready to start!
